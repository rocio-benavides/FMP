Final Master Project for MSc Omics Data Analysis

Colorectal cancer is a major global health issue, while neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery is standard, 
about 15-20% of patients achieve a pathologic complete response where surgery might be unnecessary. Radiomics features 
were extracted to develop a radiomics signature based on simulation computed tomography integrating clinicopathologic 
variables to predict pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant treatment in locally advanced rectal cancer. 
Accuracy, precision, area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity and F1 score were determined. 
Results suggest that artificial intelligence analysis of radiomics with clinicopathologic variables offers a promising non-invasive 
approach as a predictive biomarker guiding to personalized conservative treatment strategies in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.
